Scope Statement:

With this challenge, I hoped to create a functional and
easy-to-use example web application that could be navigated and
utilized with little confusion, and that was also pleasant
on the eyes. I wanted to create the four required pages to
the best of my ability along with a home page to act as a hub between
them.
